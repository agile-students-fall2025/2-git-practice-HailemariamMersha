## Summary
In 1945, Vannevar Bush wrote about how science should focus on helping humans manage knowledge.  
He imagined a device called the **memex** that could:  
- Store books and records  
- Link related ideas (like hyperlinks)  
- Let people build “trails” of thought  
- Make information easier to find and use

## What I Find Interesting
- **Ahead of its time**: Bush basically described ideas that became the web, hyperlinks, and modern knowledge tools.  
- **Human + machine**: He saw machines as helpers, not replacements — doing the boring parts so humans can think creatively.  
- **Too much information**: Even in 1945, he worried about information overload — a problem we still face today.  
- **Design lesson**: Tools should match how people think and connect ideas, not just store data.  

- **Abinet's Comment**: I like this article very much. it inspired the www as we know it today.
